This repository contains an extraordinary project! Machine learning is helping medical doctors to obtain maximum accuracy! 

### Please star, fork and cite if you use! 

### How to use?
1. First you need to train your model. use folder _Train_. Run _maincode_ to build your model.<br>
<b>NOTICE</b>: for Inception V3, you need to change input image sizes. <br>
<b>Dataset </b> folder should have two subfolders. _NORMAL_ and _COVID_. <br>
<b>Models</b> will be savel in a folder with this name. 
2. Second step is related to Google Cloud Platform. <br>
_main.py_ is handler function which calls our ML model on server and use its power to evaluate images! <br>
<b>NOTICE</b> that you should put your prefered _.h5_ model in this folder and modify the code.
3. Now it's time to run our site! you can use my theme! <br>
_script.js_ contains all JS we need to transfer images and results!
<br> <b>Notice</b> that the models in this repository are trained by images collected by my own!

### Results for VGG16:
